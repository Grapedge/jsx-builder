# JSX Builder

The second part of my graduation project. Split from main repo for some reason.

Try writing in `rescript`, it might be a challenge.

## Overview of how it works

- [x] Read react js code
- [ ] Render via babel, wrap the `JsxUnitElement` component for the following nodes:
  - JSXElement
  - JSXFragment
  - JSXText
  - JSXExpressionContainer(for child elements)
- [ ] The user transforms the code by `commands` (the bottom uses babel)

Hope to be at least 60% done this weekend.
